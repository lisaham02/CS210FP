# CS210 FINAL PROJECT - LISA HAMMACHE & SHREYA AGGARWAL

Healthcare for Data Management and Analysis

Project Definition: This project will help provide reliable, accurate, and early predictions of diabetes based on a healthcare dataset. This is crucial, as medical patients and practitioners can help deal with adverse health issues and complications before the patients get severely unhealthy. In this project, data collection/cleaning and predictive model development will be pivotal strategic aspects involved. This relates to this class as data management, especially when dealing with healthcare data, requires housing and maintaining quality data that is standardized, secure, and scalable to hold big data. Additionally, it is important to note the importance of handling and storing confidential patient data, which is a legal requirement under HIPAA regulations.
